 * File Name: Main.java
 * Description: This class serves as the entry point for the beverage machine application.
 * It demonstrates the usage of the Strategy Pattern in the context of a beverage preparation
 * system, specifically focusing on creating a customizable beverage by selecting a base drink
 * and adding various condiments. It showcases how to set up a beverage machine, choose a
 * beverage, add condiments, prepare the drink, and calculate the total cost. This example is
 * particularly useful for understanding how to apply design patterns in a real-world scenario,
 * providing a practical framework for software development tasks in the course. It emphasizes
 * the importance of JUnit tests for ensuring the reliability and functionality of each component
 * in the software design.
