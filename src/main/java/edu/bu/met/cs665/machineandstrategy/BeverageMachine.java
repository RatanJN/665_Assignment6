 * File Name: BeverageMachine.java
 * Description: The BeverageMachine class encapsulates the functionality of a beverage 
 * preparation system, integrating the Strategy Pattern for beverage and condiment selection.
 * It allows for dynamic configuration of beverage recipes and the addition of condiments,
 * facilitating the preparation of customized drinks. The class demonstrates how design 
 * patterns can enhance flexibility and extensibility in software systems, particularly in 
 * applications requiring dynamic behavior based on user preferences or inputs. By employing
 * strategies for both beverage brewing and condiment addition, it showcases a modular approach 
 * to software design, where changes in the brewing process or pricing strategy can be made 
 * with minimal impact on the overall system architecture. This class is central to the 
 * simulation of a beverage machine, illustrating practical applications of design patterns 
 * in managing complex software development challenges.
